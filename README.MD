# CrowdlabCsv

Basic setup:
    - git clone [repo url]
    - bundle install
    - rake db:migrate
    - rake db:seed
    - rspec
    - rails s

The test suit is by no means exhaustive, i assume i have demonstrated enough knowledge in various parts not to repeat the exercise for the sake of it.

The interface is not production quality, since you specify that you are 'looking for good practice rather than a polished tool' i have foregone taking time to do exhaustive validation and UX work. Needless to say there is no auth, roles and crud, this is just bare bone project to demonstrate aptitude.

To demonstrate git skills, I have added a patch with some extra stuff, after initial look through apply the patch, run bundle and spot the difference!


Enjoy :)
